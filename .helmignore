Subject: Farewell and Thank You

Dear [Team/Colleagues],

As some of you may know, today marks my last working day at [Company/Organization]. It has been a wonderful journey filled with learning, growth, and memorable experiences, and I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude.

Working at [Company/Organization] has been a significant chapter in my professional life. I have had the privilege of working with an incredible team of talented and supportive colleagues. Each one of you has contributed to my growth, both professionally and personally, and for that, I am deeply thankful.

I am excited about the new opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, but I will always look back fondly on my time here. The friendships and connections I have made will stay with me, and I hope to keep in touch with many of you.

Please feel free to reach out to me at [personal email address] or connect with me on [LinkedIn/social media]. I would love to stay in touch and hear about all the great things you continue to achieve.

Thank you once again for the support, collaboration, and camaraderie. Wishing all of you continued success and happiness in your future endeavors.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
